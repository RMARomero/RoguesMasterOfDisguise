Size:
This is a large room.
This is a medium sized room.
This is a small room.

Condition:
The room is tidy. It's almost... suspicious.
The room is pretty messy.
There are a few blood stains on the floor.
There is so much blood in here, there must have been a massacre.

Decoration:
There is a bed in the right corner. It's in a bad shape, though.
There is a couche and a fireplace near the wall. Surprisingly enough, it seems pretty.. cozy.
There is no furnature at all in this room. Such a waste of space!
It looks like all the furnature in this room has moved somewhere else. There is dust missing on the ground where objects used to be present.

Lightning:
It's really dark in here, just a small light near the wall.
The lightning in this room is pretty balanced. I can clearly see everything, I think.
There are soo many lights in here.. I almost can't see!
